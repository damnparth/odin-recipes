		<ul>
			
		<li>½ pound dark roast ground coffee beans</li>
		<li>cheesecloth</li>
		<li>coffee filters</li>
		<li>5 cups 1% milk</li>
		<li>½ (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
		<li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>

		</ul>
		<h1>steps</h1>
		<ol>

	<li>Mix 6 cups water and coffee in a 1/2-gallon jar (such as Ball) until grounds are completely saturated. Steep for 24 hours at room temperature, stirring occasionally.</li>
		<li>Transfer coffee to the refrigerator and chill for 1 hour.</li>
		<li>Place a small colander on top of a tall, lidded plastic container. Line the colander with a 6-inch square of cheesecloth; fit a coffee filter on top.</li>
		<li>Pour about 1 cup of the coffee into the colander until filter begins to clog. Lift the corners of the cheesecloth carefully; twist the cloth and filter to extract the liquid. Drain the remaining liquid 1 cup at a time, using a new coffee filter each time. Repeat the process with the grounds, filtering 1 cup at a time; squeeze out as much liquid as you can. Refrigerate the concentrate until ready to use.</li>
		
		<li>Combine concentrate, 1% milk, and condensed milk in a 1/2-gallon jar.</li>
		<li>Dissolve 3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon sugar and cocoa powder together in a bowl of hot tap water. Add to the coffee-milk mixture; cover the jar and shake well.</li>
